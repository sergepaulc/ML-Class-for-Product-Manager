A Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning for Product Managers
(B) I taught a machine learning class to Product Managers two years ago. I have slightly updated the content of that class. A lot of Product Managers working on machine learning are contacting me on LinkedIn. So, I am hoping that the following materials might be useful to someone.

## Class 1
ML University for PM Class 1

Videos:
- Professor Andrew Ng: Artificial Intelligence is the New Electricity at Stanford GSB: https://youtu.be/21EiKfQYZXc

Readings:
- Wikipedia: Linear regression https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression
- Wikipedia: Logistic regression https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression
- Wikipedia: K-means clustering https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering 

Homework:
1. Select a few ML applications that you are using every day on your desktop or your mobile phone. Classify them into supervised or unsupervised learning. Try to identify the source of the data. Try to define how as a product/program manager or a product designer, you will consider those apps successful and which metrics, you might use to measure the app success. Please put your thoughts in a google document that you can share.
2. Propose a few applications that could be developed using an estimation (based on a regression), a classification (based on a logistic regression), and a segmentation (based on a K-means clustering). Please put your thoughts in a google document that you can share.

Videos:
- A machine learning primer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M09i0f3ruI&t=22s

(Please watch that video a couple of times, until you get it 🙂 We have not covered yet the K-nearest neighbor and Support Vector Machine algorithms but still try to understand those two algos)

Readings:
- Wikipedia: Decision trees learning https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning
- Wikipedia: Ensemble learning https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning
- Wikipedia: Random forest https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest
- Wikipedia: Artificial neural network https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network

Optional (and advanced but interesting):
- Professor Michael Jordan from UC Berkeley, Perspectives and Challenges of ML: https://youtu.be/4inIBmY8dQI

Homework:
1. You have been hired to be the first Product Designer, Product Manager, or Program Manager for the Intelligence Platform at Sony Kamaji. Your first assignment is to lead the development of an ML application for classifying Sony games. To get started on that assignment, please propose a small draft of your proposed plan for that app. Please put your thoughts in the same google document that you use for your previous homework.
2. Since you completed ahead of schedule and with a lower budget your classification app for Sony games, you are now being asked to develop a segmentation app of SONY users. That app could leverage the labels of your classification apps. Please put your thoughts in the same google document that you use for your previous homework.

Note: You can be as creative as you want in terms of the product plan that you will use to drive the development of those apps but at least describe the “what” and “why” of the apps, the data sources/features, the possible models, and any KPIs.
If you are running out of time, just do something simple in a few sentences for each homework in ½ page. If you have time, do as much as you can 🙂

Homework:
- Answer the following questions. Note: please limit your answers to a few concise sentences:
1. What is a labeled training set?
2. What are the two most common tasks that a supervised machine learning model can do?
3. Give the name of a common task that an unsupervised machine learning model can do?
4. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithm hyperparameter?
5. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you mention some possible solutions?
6. What is a test data set and why would you want to use it?
7. Why feature engineering is a critical task for a data scientist to perform in order to develop a model that provides some good predictions?
8. When training a model, a data scientist might use an algorithm to reduce the cost or loss function of the model? What is in that case, the cost function?
9. What are the advantages of using a deep learning model compared to other traditional machine learning models?
10. Why deep learning models are somewhat considered as a “black box” model compared for instance to decision trees that are considered as a “white box” model?
